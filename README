tclreadline


1. Introduction
---------------

This directory contains the sources and documentation for tclreadline,
which builds a connection between tcl and the gnu readline.
The information here corresponds to release 1.0.

2. Documentation
----------------

The tclreadline.n nroff man page in this release contains the reference
manual entries for tclreadline.  If you only want to use tclreadline as
a tool for interactive script development,  you don't have to read this
manual page at all.  Simply change your .tclshrc according to the section 4.

3. Compiling and installing tclreadline
---------------------------------------

This release will probably only build under UNIX (Linux).

Before trying to compile tclreadline you should do the following things:

    (a) Make sure you have tcl 8.0 or higher.  I've tested tclreadline
        with tcl 8.0.3 and 8.0.4.  tclreadline relies on a proper tcl
        installation:
        It uses the tclConfig.sh file, which should reside somewhere
        in /usr/local/lib/ or /usr/local/lib/tcl8.0/...

    (b) Make sure you have gnu readline 2.2 or higher.
        tclreadline uses the gnu readline callback handler, which
        wasn't implemented in early releases.

The usual ./configure; make; make install sequence should do the rest.


4. Using tclreadline for interactive tcl scripting.
---------------------------------------------------

copy the sample.tclshrc to $HOME/.tclshrc. If you use another interpreter
like wish, you should copy the file sample.tclshrc to $HOME/.wishrc
(or whatever the manual page of your interpreter says.) If you have
installed tclreadline properly, you are just ready to start:
start your favorite interpreter. The tclreadlineSetup.tcl script
does the rest.
