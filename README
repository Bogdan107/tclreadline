1. Introduction
---------------

This directory contains the sources and documentation for tclreadline,
which builds a connection between tcl and the gnu readline.
The information here corresponds to release 0.7 (initial developers release).

2. Documentation
----------------

The "doc" subdirectory in this release contains the reference manual entries
for tclreadline.  If you only want to use tclreadline as a tool for interactive
script development,  you don't have to read this manual page at all.  Simply
change your .tclshrc according to the next section.

3. Compiling and installing tclreadline
-------------------------------

This release will probably only build under UNIX (Linux).

Before trying to compile tclreadline you should do the following things:

    (a) Make sure you have tcl 8.0 or higher.  I've tested tclreadline
        with tcl 8.0.3 and 8.0.4.  tclreadline relies on a proper tcl
        installation:
        It uses the tclConfig.sh file, which should reside somewhere
        in /usr/local/lib/ or /usr/local/lib/tcl8.0/...
